# From Excel to Experience Cloud: Automating Partner Submissions

Partner submissions are the bane of every B2B company's existence. Whether it's partner applications, deal registrations, or marketing co-op requests, the process is usually a mess of Excel spreadsheets, email chains, and manual approvals that take weeks to complete. I've seen companies lose deals and partners because their submission process is so cumbersome that people give up.

After helping dozens of B2B companies automate their partner submission processes with Experience Cloud, I've learned that the key to success isn't just building a better formâ€”it's reimagining the entire workflow to be partner-centric, efficient, and scalable.

## The Excel Problem

**Manual data entry** is error-prone and time-consuming. Partners have to fill out the same information multiple times, and your team has to re-enter it into different systems.

**No visibility** means partners don't know where their submission stands, and your team can't track progress or identify bottlenecks.

**Approval bottlenecks** create delays that frustrate partners and slow down your business. One missing signature can hold up a deal for weeks.

**Data silos** mean that partner information is scattered across different systems and spreadsheets, making it impossible to get a complete picture of your partner relationships.

**No automation** means that every submission requires manual processing, which doesn't scale as your partner program grows.

## The Experience Cloud Solution

**Self-service portal** allows partners to submit applications, track progress, and manage their information without involving your team. This reduces workload and improves partner satisfaction.

**Automated workflows** handle routing, approvals, and notifications without manual intervention. This speeds up the process and reduces errors.

**Unified data model** stores all partner information in one place, making it easy to track relationships and generate insights.

**Integration capabilities** connect the partner portal to your CRM, marketing automation, and other systems, eliminating data silos and manual data entry.

**Scalable architecture** grows with your partner program without requiring additional resources or complex maintenance.

## The Partner Application Process

**Streamlined forms** collect only the information you need, when you need it. Use conditional logic to show relevant fields based on partner type and previous responses.

**Document upload** allows partners to submit required documents directly through the portal, eliminating email attachments and version control issues.

**Real-time validation** checks for completeness and accuracy before submission, reducing back-and-forth and improving data quality.

**Progress tracking** shows partners exactly where their application stands and what's needed next. This reduces support requests and improves satisfaction.

**Automated notifications** keep partners informed about status changes and required actions, reducing the need for manual follow-up.

## The Deal Registration Process

**Deal submission** allows partners to register deals quickly and easily, with all the information needed for approval and tracking.

**Automated validation** checks for duplicate deals, validates partner eligibility, and ensures all required information is provided.

**Approval workflows** route deals to the right approvers based on deal size, partner tier, and other criteria. This ensures consistent processing and reduces approval time.

**Commission tracking** calculates and tracks commissions automatically, eliminating manual calculations and disputes.

**Integration with CRM** ensures that registered deals are properly tracked in your sales pipeline and partner performance metrics.

## The Marketing Co-op Process

**Campaign submission** allows partners to submit marketing co-op requests with all the required information and supporting materials.

**Budget tracking** monitors available co-op funds and ensures that requests don't exceed available budgets.

**Approval workflows** route requests to the right approvers based on amount, campaign type, and partner tier.

**Performance tracking** monitors the success of co-op campaigns and provides insights for future planning.

**Automated reporting** generates regular reports on co-op usage, performance, and ROI for both partners and your team.

## The Technical Implementation

**Custom objects** store partner data, submissions, and workflow information in a structured way that's easy to query and report on.

**Process Builder** automates workflows and approvals based on business rules and criteria.

**Lightning components** create a modern, responsive user interface that works on all devices.

**Integration APIs** connect the partner portal to your existing systems and data sources.

**Security and sharing** ensure that partners only see their own data and that sensitive information is protected.

## The Common Pitfalls

**Over-complicating the process** can make the portal harder to use than the Excel workflow it's replacing. Focus on simplicity and ease of use.

**Ignoring partner feedback** means you're building what you think partners want, not what they actually need. Involve partners in the design process.

**Skipping testing** can lead to a portal that doesn't work properly or that partners can't figure out how to use.

**Under-estimating change management** means partners won't adopt the new system, and you'll end up with both Excel and Experience Cloud processes running in parallel.

## The ROI of Automation

Automating partner submissions delivers significant ROI through:

**Reduced manual work** by eliminating data entry and manual processing
**Faster processing** through automated workflows and approvals
**Better partner satisfaction** through self-service capabilities and real-time visibility
**Improved data quality** through validation and structured data collection
**Scalable growth** without requiring additional resources

I've seen clients reduce partner submission processing time by 80% while improving partner satisfaction by 60% through automation.

## The Change Management Strategy

**Partner training** ensures that partners know how to use the new system and understand the benefits.

**Gradual rollout** allows you to test and refine the system with a small group before scaling to all partners.

**Support resources** help partners transition from Excel to Experience Cloud, including documentation, training, and help desk support.

**Feedback collection** allows partners to provide input on the system and suggest improvements.

## Getting Started

If you're ready to automate your partner submission process, here's your roadmap:

1. **Audit your current process** and identify the biggest pain points and inefficiencies
2. **Design your new workflow** with partner experience and business needs in mind
3. **Build a pilot** with one partner type or submission process
4. **Test thoroughly** with real partners and real submissions
5. **Roll out gradually** and collect feedback for continuous improvement

## Key Takeaway

Partner submissions don't have to be a manual, error-prone nightmare. With Experience Cloud, you can build a self-service portal that partners love to use and that scales with your business. The key is to focus on partner experience and business efficiency, not just replacing Excel with a database.

Stop forcing partners to use Excel. Give them a modern, self-service portal that makes their lives easier and your business more efficient.
