# Building Triggered Sends That Convert

![blog7-image1](./blog/building-triggered-sends-that-convert/1.1.png)

Triggered sends work when they reach the right person at the right moment with the right message. This isn't about sending faster; it's about sending smarter.

## Get the trigger right
- Define the event clearly: purchase, cart view, browse abandon, signup, password reset, form submit, milestone.
- Guardrails: require key attributes (email, consent status, locale, brand) and suppress when data is incomplete.
- De-duplication: prevent multiple sends for repeated events; add an idempotency key and a time window.

## Data and timing
- Fresh context: fetch or reference the latest product, price, or status at send time.
- Latency budget: decide how "fresh" the trigger must be and queue anything older into a nurture.
- Quiet hours & frequency caps: respect preferences, time zones, and channel limits.

## Message that earns the click
- Subject & preview: one clear benefit + one context cue.
- Above the fold: primary action first; secondary links later.
- Personalization basics: name, product/category, location or store, status.
- Reassurance: reviews, returns, shipping timelines, support.

## Variants and testing
- Two strong variants > many weak ones.
- Holdout group to prove lift.
- Device checks: mobile-first, fast load, alt text.

## Journey logic
- Failover paths if data is missing.
- Stop conditions after conversion/state change.
- Cooling periods to avoid stacking.

## Measurement that proves value
Track conversion rate, AOV/revenue per email, time-to-convert, assisted conversions, unsub/complaints; attribute at trigger cohort level with a holdout.

## Deliverability + compliance
SPF/DKIM/DMARC, warmed domains, clean lists; consent honored, clear prefs/support links.

## Ops runbook
Monitoring (volume, failures, render errors, queue time); alerts & retries with backoff; change control with versioning and rollback.

### Checklist
- Trigger defined and de-duplicated
- Required fields present; fallback ready
- Frequency caps and quiet hours set
- Conversion event mapped for stop logic
- 2 test variants + holdout configured
- Metrics dashboard and alerting live
- Runbook documented; rollback tested

### Closing Thought
Great triggered sends feel obvious: timely, useful, easy to act on. Focus on fewer, better messages driven by solid data and simple decisions.
