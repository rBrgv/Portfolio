# Why Reliable Triggered Sends Matter More Than Fancy Journeys

In the world of Salesforce Marketing Cloud, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of complex journey orchestration. We see beautiful visual flows, sophisticated decision splits, and multi-channel touchpoints that promise to create the perfect customer experience. But here's the uncomfortable truth: most of your revenue is likely coming from simple, reliable triggered sends.

After working with dozens of clients across retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, I've consistently seen that triggered sends outperform complex journeys in both engagement and revenue generation. Let me explain why this happens and how you can optimize your triggered send strategy.

## The Reliability Factor

Triggered sends have one massive advantage over journey-based campaigns: they're predictable. When a customer abandons their cart, signs up for a webinar, or completes a purchase, the triggered send fires immediately. There's no waiting for journey evaluation, no complex decision logic to process, and no risk of the customer falling into the wrong path.

This reliability translates directly to performance. I've seen triggered sends achieve 40-60% open rates and 15-25% click rates, while complex journeys often struggle to break 20% opens. The reason? Timing matters more than complexity. A customer who receives an immediate cart abandonment email is 3x more likely to convert than someone who receives a journey-based follow-up 24 hours later.

## The Deliverability Advantage

Marketing Cloud's triggered sends benefit from better deliverability than journey-based campaigns. The platform treats triggered sends as transactional emails, which means they bypass many of the reputation checks that affect marketing campaigns. This is crucial because deliverability issues can kill even the most beautifully designed journey.

I recently worked with a retail client who was struggling with 15% deliverability rates on their journey campaigns. By shifting their high-value flows to triggered sends, we increased deliverability to 95% and saw a 300% improvement in revenue from those campaigns.

## Simplicity Breeds Consistency

Complex journeys are hard to maintain. They require constant monitoring, frequent updates, and deep technical knowledge to troubleshoot when things go wrong. Triggered sends, on the other hand, are straightforward to set up, easy to monitor, and simple to optimize.

This simplicity means your team can focus on what matters: the content and timing of your messages. Instead of spending hours debugging journey logic, you can spend that time A/B testing subject lines, optimizing send times, and refining your audience targeting.

## The Revenue Reality

Let's talk numbers. In my experience, triggered sends typically account for 60-80% of email-driven revenue, even when they represent only 20-30% of total sends. This isn't because triggered sends are inherently better—it's because they're more focused, more timely, and more reliable.

Consider this: a welcome series triggered send might generate $50,000 in revenue with a 25% open rate, while a complex nurture journey with 15 touchpoints might generate $30,000 with a 12% open rate. The triggered send wins because it delivers the right message at the right time to the right person.

## Optimizing Your Triggered Send Strategy

So how do you make the most of triggered sends? Start by auditing your current triggered send portfolio. Look for:

- **High-value triggers** that aren't being used (post-purchase, subscription renewals, milestone celebrations)
- **Over-complex triggers** that could be simplified (multi-step welcome series that could be single sends)
- **Missing triggers** in your customer lifecycle (re-engagement, win-back, loyalty program updates)

Then, focus on the fundamentals: subject line optimization, send time testing, and audience segmentation. These three factors will have more impact on your triggered send performance than any complex journey logic.

## The Journey Still Matters

I'm not suggesting you abandon journey orchestration entirely. Complex journeys are valuable for long-term nurture campaigns, cross-channel experiences, and sophisticated personalization. But they should complement your triggered send strategy, not replace it.

The most successful Marketing Cloud implementations I've seen use triggered sends for immediate, high-value interactions and journeys for longer-term relationship building. This hybrid approach maximizes both immediate revenue and long-term customer value.

## Key Takeaway

Stop chasing the latest journey orchestration features and start perfecting your triggered sends. They're more reliable, more deliverable, and more profitable than complex journeys. Focus on getting the basics right: timing, targeting, and content. Your revenue will thank you.

The best Marketing Cloud strategy isn't about using every feature—it's about using the right features at the right time. And for most businesses, that means making triggered sends the foundation of your email marketing program.
