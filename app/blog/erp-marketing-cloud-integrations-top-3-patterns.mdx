# ERP Integration Patterns for Marketing Cloud

![blog8-image1](./blog/erp-integration-patterns-marketing-cloud/1.1.png)

ERP data is the backbone of useful marketing. Products, prices, inventory, orders, shipments, invoices. When this information reaches Marketing Cloud in a reliable way, you can power relevant messages, accurate personalization, and trustworthy analytics.

## What marketing actually needs from ERP
- Customer and account hierarchy for segmentation and B2B targeting
- Products and SKUs for recommendations and content blocks
- Pricing and promotions where allowed by policy
- Inventory status for back in stock and low inventory messages
- Orders, shipments, returns for transactional and lifecycle triggers
- Invoices and balances for statements and payment reminders

## Common integration patterns
1) Batch file drops (SFTP or object storage)
Best when volume is high and latency can be hours.
Tips: use control files, checksums, file versioning, and a watermark column for deltas.

2) Scheduled API pulls
Good when the ERP exposes stable endpoints and volume is moderate.
Tips: page results, use updated_since filters, respect rate limits.

3) Event or webhook push
Use when you need near real time. Order_created, shipment_updated, return_received.
Tips: require an idempotency key to avoid duplicates, queue retries, capture dead letters.

4) Change Data Capture and streams
Ideal for high frequency updates with low latency.
Tips: maintain ordering per entity, compact multi-update bursts, persist offsets.

5) Middleware or iPaaS relay
Great for mapping, orchestration, and policy control.
Tips: centralize transformations, own error handling, standardize logging and alerts.

6) Hybrid
Batch for heavy reference data. Events for critical moments. Align each feed to its SLA.

## Data modeling in Marketing Cloud
- Staging DEs to land raw feeds.
- Master DEs for cleaned, deduped records with stable primary keys.
- History or audit DEs for changes you may need to replay.
- Failed rows DE to park bad data for correction.
- Keys to agree with ERP: CustomerId, OrderNumber, SKU, LineNumber.
- Technical fields: hash, change_type, loaded_at, source_file, upsert_ts.
- Use a clear send relationship so personalization pulls from the right DE every time.

## Reliability and trust
- Idempotency. Upsert by natural key. Treat repeats as no-ops.
- Deduping. Use a deterministic hash per row to detect unchanged records.
- Ordering. Process by entity and time to avoid stale overwrites.
- Retries and backoff. Cap retries and move poison messages to a parking lot.
- Monitoring. Track volume, lag, failure rate, and schema drift. Alert on thresholds.

## Security and compliance
- Minimize PII in marketing payloads. Bring only what you use.
- Encrypt in transit and at rest.
- Mask sensitive fields in logs and error DEs.
- Respect consent and purpose limits. Keep retention windows short by default.

## Choosing the right pattern
- Need sub minute speed. Use events or CDC.
- Need simple nightly refresh at scale. Use batch files.
- Complex mapping and multiple targets. Use middleware.
- Unstable ERP APIs or rate limits. Prefer batch with deltas.
- Regulated data with strict governance. Centralize in middleware and expose only approved fields.

## Reference flows
- Order confirmation. ERP posts an order_created event to middleware. Middleware validates, enriches, and triggers a send in Marketing Cloud.
- Back in stock. Nightly inventory batch updates a DE. Audience refresh runs a journey that notifies subscribers who requested the item.
- Invoice available. ERP exports invoices nightly. File lands in staging, transforms to master DE, journey sends statement links to opted in contacts.

## Ops runbook
- Schedules and SLAs for each feed
- Control file format and naming convention
- Validation rules and rejection reasons
- Replay procedure and backfill steps
- Alert routing and on-call ownership
- Change control with versioning and rollback

## Quick checklist
- Clear use cases and SLAs
- Agreed keys and field dictionary with ERP
- Pattern chosen per feed with reasons
- Idempotent upserts and dedupe logic
- Monitoring, alerts, and dashboards live
- Security review and retention policy approved

### Closing thought
Pick the simplest pattern that meets the SLA. Make keys and contracts explicit. Prove reliability first, then scale.
